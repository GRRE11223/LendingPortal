Project Proposal: Phase 1 Plan for Private Lending Portal
1. Overview
This proposal presents the feature set and technical goals for Phase 1 of the Private Lending Portal. The platform is built to support a white-label experience for lending partners, enabling them to manage the entire borrower lifecycle through a streamlined and branded digital interface, with Bluebono serves as the back office support on underwriting, funding and servicing. 
Key capabilities of the portal include:
Direct borrower interaction, setup a borrower portal or just making direct borrower a partner with single user type access  
Partner-branded borrower interaction, with no direct exposure to Bluebono.
Pre-defined but customizable workflows, tailored to each partner‚Äôs operational needs.
Automated task management and role-based access control.
Integrated document handling, communication tools, and milestone tracking.
2. Loan Submission Module
This module outlines how loans are submitted to the portal, how borrower and partner interactions are handled, and how automation and control are applied throughout the process.

2.1 Platform Behavior & General Setup
White-Label Design & Borrower Flow Control
Each partner is assigned a custom white-label landing page, giving them full brand control and consistency with their borrower experience.
The portal is designed to accurately identify and attribute each borrower application to the correct partner channel, using the partner‚Äôs unique landing page or other technical identifiers embedded in the submission process‚Äîwithout requiring any action from the borrower.
Loan ID System
A centralized loan ID system will be implemented with:
Auto-generation of unique IDs for every application.
Option to include partner-specific prefixes (e.g., ABC123456).
All IDs will be tracked, searchable, and stored for auditing and reporting.
Prevents duplication across the platform.
Task Assignment Rules
To ensure scalable team operations, task assignments are designed for flexibility and automation:
Admins can define logic-based rules to assign loan files automatically based on:
Partner source
Loan status or stage
Type of loan program
Group-based assignments are supported:
For example, assigning all files from Partner ABC to ‚ÄúWest Coast Loan Coordinators‚Äù instead of one individual.
Manual reassignment is available at any stage for exceptions or special handling.

2.2 Borrower Workflow
Borrowers interact with the portal initially through a partner‚Äôs landing page and only formally register when submitting an application.
Anonymous Start & Lead Creation
Borrowers begin applications without logging in or registering.
After completing 50% of the application, the system:
Saves progress
Creates a Lead entry in the system (marked as Lead status)
Formal Submission & Account Creation
When borrowers reach the final step and click ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù, the system prompts:
Portal account registration
Presentation of industry-standard disclosures, including:
Consent to electronic communications (eSign Act)
Authorization to pull credit
Other applicable legal disclosures
Once the borrower creates an account and uploads the first document, the loan file is marked as Active.
Authentication & Accessibility
Borrowers can use Single Sign-On (SSO) through:
Gmail
Outlook
Apple ID
Secure OAuth login streamlines their first and only required sign-in.
Follow-Up & Off-Portal Communication
To reduce friction:
Additional document requests or borrower responses are sent via secure, anonymous links‚Äîno login required.
Emails can be fully customized to reflect partner branding:
Sender name
Subject line
Email body
Design Philosophy
Borrowers are only required to log in once to complete onboarding (registration, disclosures, and initial uploads).
After onboarding, they can respond to follow-ups exclusively through secure links, allowing for a low-friction, high-completion experience.

2.3 Partner Workflow
Partners are given full visibility and control over their borrower pipeline based on permissions defined in their user settings.
Control & Flexibility
Partners may manage:
The entire borrower journey, or
Select stages depending on their internal processes and delegation preferences.
Role-Based Task Assignment
Tasks can be directed:
To all users within a partner‚Äôs portal
To specific roles (e.g., Partner Admin only)
To individual users within the partner team
Follow-up actions (e.g., missing document requests) can be assigned solely to the partner, separate from Bluebono involvement.
Access Requirements
All partner actions must be performed within the portal.
SSO login support is strongly encouraged to simplify access and ensure secure authentication.


3. User Roles, Status Tracking & Workflow Visibility
This section defines user roles across both Bluebono and partner environments and outlines how loans are tracked through statuses, milestones, activity logs, and document reviews. It establishes a clear framework for task ownership, process visibility, and communication clarity throughout the loan lifecycle.

3.1 User Roles & Access Definitions
Bluebono Internal Roles
These roles are responsible for platform-wide operations, task management, and oversight:
Superadmin
Full control over the entire system.
Manages partners, user roles, permissions, and configurations.
Admin
Oversees day-to-day workflow operations.
Assigns and reassigns tasks, monitors file progress, and ensures procedural compliance.
Loan Coordinator
Responsible for document collection, file reviews, and compliance verification.
Ensures loan files meet internal requirements prior to final processing.
Partner-Side Roles
Partner organizations will manage loan files based on roles defined within their portal access:
Partner Admin
Manages partner users and permissions.
Oversees loan status and workflow visibility.
Loan Officer
Main point of contact for the borrower.
Collects documents, manages application progress, and updates file records.
Loan Assistant
Provides administrative support to the Loan Officer.
Verifies document completeness, updates system status, and assists with borrower communications.
Borrower
Accesses the portal via a partner-branded landing page or through a direct login flow.
Interacts primarily through initial onboarding and document uploads.
Note: Additional role layers and permission tiers may be introduced based on partner needs and operational complexity.

3.2 Loan Status Definitions
Loan statuses reflect a file‚Äôs internal progress and are used by Bluebono and partners for file management, prioritization, and workflow tracking:
Lead ‚Äì A partially completed borrower application.
Active ‚Äì A submitted and accepted loan application.
Servicing ‚Äì A funded loan currently under repayment management.
Complete ‚Äì A fully closed and archived loan file.
On Hold ‚Äì A temporarily paused application due to internal or external issues.
Canceled ‚Äì A withdrawn or rejected application.

3.3 Loan Milestones & Notifications
Milestones provide real-time visibility into key events within a loan‚Äôs lifecycle and are used to notify both internal users and external parties (e.g., borrowers, partners, escrow):
Milestone Types
Title & Escrow
Appraisal
In Review
Ready to Fund
Funded
Servicing
Payoff
On Hold
Canceled
Milestone Features & Flexibility
Trigger Rules: Admins can define rules for actions (e.g., notifications, assignments) when milestones are reached.
Manual Override: Milestones can be manually updated as needed.
Custom Messaging:
Each milestone can include preset explanations to provide clarity when notices are sent.
The system can translate internal milestone names into more user-friendly terms for borrowers and non-technical recipients.
Example: Instead of ‚ÄúUnderwriting,‚Äù a borrower might see ‚ÄúReview in Progress.‚Äù

3.4 Activity Log
The system maintains a detailed audit trail of all significant user actions for transparency, compliance, and troubleshooting.
Log Components
Timestamp ‚Äì Exact date and time of the action.
User ‚Äì Name and role of the user who performed the action.
Action Description ‚Äì Clear summary of the task or update made.

3.5 Document Review Status Indicators
All uploaded documents will be reviewed and classified using a standardized color-coded system to streamline review workflows and enhance file visibility.
Document Status Types
‚úÖ Approved ‚Äì Meets all requirements and no further action is needed.
‚ùå Rejected ‚Äì Does not meet standards; must be corrected or replaced.
üü° Pending Review ‚Äì Awaiting internal verification or additional input.
4. Pipeline Dashboard Design Plan
The Pipeline Dashboard is a central interface that enables users to monitor, navigate, and manage loan files efficiently. It should offer a high-level overview of the lending pipeline, with tools for deep dives into loan-level data, visual indicators for workflow stages, and intelligent data filtering to support task prioritization and operational insight.

Dashboard examples: 









4.1 Dashboard Views & Navigation
To accommodate different user needs, the platform will include two primary views for the loan pipeline:
Columns View
Serves as the master table of all loan files.
Displays all data points including:
Loan ID, Partner, Status, Borrower Name
Assigned User, Stage, Document Completion %, etc.
Acts as the core view for filtering, bulk actions, and deep-dive analysis.
Diagram View (Bubble Chart)
Provides a visual overview of loans by major status categories (e.g., Lead, Active, Funded).
Each status is represented as a bubble, with:
Size proportional to loan volume
Hover tooltips showing counts and brief metrics
Clicking a bubble redirects users to the filtered Columns View for that status.
Suggestion: Include a legend above the diagram with status definitions and color codes for quick reference.

4.2 Interactive Dashboard Capabilities
Clickable Interactions
Users can interact directly with visual widgets:
Click on statuses, loan purposes, or date ranges.
Redirects to filtered data views or related tasks.
Filtering Options
Filters should be available on both dashboard and list views.
Filters by below examples but could be more.
Loan status
Partner
Assigned user
Loan amount
Timeframe (e.g., last 30 days)
Borrower name or Loan ID, etc.

Access Control
Bluebono Admins: See full pipeline across all partners.
Partner Admins: See only their own organization‚Äôs loans.
Other Users (Loan Officers, Assistants): See only loans assigned to them or within their teams.
Suggestion: Add quick filters such as ‚ÄúMy Loans‚Äù and ‚ÄúRecently Updated‚Äù to improve user flow.

4.3 Loan List View Enhancements
Data Visualization & Reporting
Integrate key visual insights such as:
Loan volume trends over time
Approval conversion rates
Average loan amount per stage or partner
Collapsible Views
Allow users to toggle between:
Summary View: Displays essential columns only (status, ID, borrower).
Detailed View: Includes workflow steps, internal notes, approval path, etc.
Reference: Use design principles similar to Monday.com or Airtable, where layouts can switch between ‚Äútable,‚Äù ‚Äúboard,‚Äù or ‚Äútimeline.‚Äù

4.4 Enhanced User Experience
Customizable Dashboards
Allow users to adjust:
Widget placement
Metric selection (e.g., loans by partner, loans by stage)
Default views or saved filters
Suggestion: Enable "Save My Layout" option so each user has a consistent view when logging in.

4.5 Loan-Level Visualization
Document Collection Progress Tracker
                          
Milestone Visual Tracker
For borrowers/partners, each loan detail view will include a visual tracker displaying the most imminent status or task that required attention in order to move forward to next milestone
Provide a preview for users to quickly see where the loan stands and which steps remain.
Suggestion: Use color indicators (e.g., gray for incomplete, green for completed) and show estimated vs. actual timeline for each phase.

4.6 Data Accessibility & Export Options
Export Functionality
Users can export current views or filtered results to:
Excel (XLSX)
CSV
Export options should include:
Choose which columns to include
Export based on filter state
Suggestion: Include export history logs for audit/compliance purposes.

4.7 AI-Powered Document Classification
Tagging & Categorization
Automatically tag uploaded documents based on type (e.g., ID, Bank Statement, Purchase Agreement).
AI will scan document content to recommend or auto-assign labels.
Intelligent Descriptions
Generate brief summaries for each document, identifying:
Type
Purpose
Whether any required information is missing

Contextual Matching
Match documents to checklist items or loan-specific conditions.
Highlight missing or mismatched files (e.g., wrong format, outdated document).
Suggestion: Allow manual override and tagging to complement AI recommendations.

4.8 Logic Engine & Rule Management
The dashboard should support logical operations that allow custom rule configuration for decision support and workflow automation.
Rule-Based Logic Functions
Conditional triggers for:
Auto-assigning loans
For each milestone, configure trigger events that either automatically advance the loan to the next stage or notify the responsible party to complete specific actions required to move the process forward.
Sending milestone notifications
Highlighting loan files that exceed a certain threshold (e.g., LTV > 75%)
Ability to define partner-specific logic without coding:
‚ÄúIf loan amount > $500K AND partner = ABC, assign to Coordinator Team B‚Äù
Suggestion: Add a visual "Rules Builder" interface for admins to create and edit rules easily.

5. Portal Specifics
Unified In-Platform Document Management
Admins require comprehensive control and full visibility over all document-related tasks. To support this, the platform must centralize all file management within a single system to:
Eliminate fragmentation across tools
Reduce redundant manual organization
Ensure documents are consistently organized, trackable, and actionable within the loan lifecycle

Core Objectives
The goal is to replace the current reliance on external storage solutions (e.g., Google Drive) by offering a robust, built-in file management experience. This includes:
In-Platform Document Organization:
All documents should be managed directly within the portal.
Loan-Linked File Structure:
Documents are tied to individual loan records, with no need for separate folder systems.
Categorization & Status Integration:
File views should reflect document types (e.g., Borrower, Escrow, Insurance), current status (Approved, Rejected, Pending), and version history.
Real-Time Synchronization:
All files remain updated and aligned with loan progress, accessible across Admin, Partner, and Client Portals.

Future Scalability
While AI-based document sorting and automation is not within the scope of Phase 1, this foundational system should be designed to:
Support the eventual integration of AI-driven classification and organization
