When I ask you to update or refactor a specific function or method, you MUST:
    1. Only make changes **within that function**.
    2. Do NOT change any other functions, variables, logic, or files.
    3. Do NOT "improve", "optimize", or "clean up" unrelated parts of the code.
    4. Do NOT reorder imports, rename variables, or make stylistic changes outside of the target scope.
    5. Do NOT auto-fix unrelated issues or add comments unless explicitly told to.
    Your job is to be precise, conservative, and focused **only** on the requested area.

    Example:
    ❌ Wrong: You update the function I requested but also renamed other variables or fixed other code smells.
    ✅ Correct: You updated only the target function, leaving all other code untouched.

    Use this rule **every time** I ask you to "change", "update", "fix", or "refactor" a specific function or component.
